# Submission Notes:

## unme99 - emerald gods home

note to whoever is adding this maybe add some people in the cryosleep and maybe add items to the stock pile

## ingedum - CastleMapQuarantine

And also a version with actual things happening, though I am not sure how much I can, or should, actually do


## twealve_h - Stingray Resort

This was a VERY melee oriented colony.
I don't know if you're using your own factions for these encounters, but if you want, i left 2 pawns of what the enemies should look like. Most of them should be melee users.

For the items on the map: It should mostly be textiles, food and rarely formal vests and trooper armors (I left some stuff on the shelves as an example)


## kreeft
Popebster for the main guy
Crabgi's as the clergi
And shrimpvants as simple workers
And maybe put taff or me in the sarcophagus
Or the graves


## dissonant_one
