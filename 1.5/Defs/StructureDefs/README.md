# Submission Notes:

## unme99 - emerald gods home

note to whoever is adding this maybe add some people in the cryosleep and maybe add items to the stock pile

## ingedum - CastleMapQuarantine

And also a version with actual things happening, though I am not sure how much I can, or should, actually do


## twealve_h - Stingray Resort

This was a VERY melee oriented colony.
I don't know if you're using your own factions for these encounters, but if you want, i left 2 pawns of what the enemies should look like. Most of them should be melee users.

For the items on the map: It should mostly be textiles, food and rarely formal vests and trooper armors (I left some stuff on the shelves as an example)


## kreeft
Popebster for the main guy
Crabgi's as the clergi
And shrimpvants as simple workers
And maybe put taff or me in the sarcophagus
Or the graves

ruined city - no loot
vault - https://discord.com/channels/480546382130708490/1379501466531790918/1380925443774877738

steel city: as said earlier i was hoping it could work like the grey labyrinth, it's kind of designed with that in mind
both graveyards: part of the random map gen, ig
loss labyrinth: part of the random map gen
uranium labyrinth: my gut instinct is to say 'only thing on the map' but it doesn't have any terrain so i suppose it doesn't really matter
cystic village: probably fine to be part of a larger map
chess labyrinth: roughly the same deal as uranium labyrinth but it's smaller
ruined city: fine to be just part of a random larger map, it's inspired by rimworld ruins anyway
distorted village: fine to be part of larger
vault: it's pretty big, but it doesn't really have terrain other than the dirt in the outdoor area, which should remain dirt
prefabbed castle: i'd say remove the terrain, but i do worry that if it's put in random biomes the roads are going to look awful
bombed out city: fine to be anywhere, although now that i think of it i probably should have had the roads fade out of the city instead of just abruptly cutting off
